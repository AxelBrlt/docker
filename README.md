# About

Welcome to my **Docker Automation Scripts** repository! 

This repository contains various scripts and Docker Compose files aimed at automating the installation of Docker and useful containerized services on virtual machines. These scripts are designed to streamline my setup process, making it easier to deploy Docker and associated services with minimal manual intervention.

# Author

Hey there! I'm **Zaek**, a french SysNet (Systems & Networking) student with a keen interest in automation and virtualization. I've created these scripts to simplify the deployment of Docker and its containers on virtual machines, a task that can sometimes be repetitive and time-consuming.

# Whatâ€™s Inside?

- **Docker Installation Scripts**: Bash scripts that automate the process of installing Docker and Docker Compose on Debian-based virtual machines.
- **Docker Compose Files**: Pre-configured YAML files for deploying commonly used containers like web servers, databases, and more.
- **Service Containers**: Useful services like WikiJS, Nextcloud, Manyfold and much more....

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Most (if not all) compose files require modification and tinkering for them to work on your system.

I hope this repository can be useful to someone !
